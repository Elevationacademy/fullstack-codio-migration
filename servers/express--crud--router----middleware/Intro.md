In this lesson we're going to explore Express more. We're going to introduce other HTTP methods and routes, talk about middleware, and learn how to build a proper, clean server with separate files.

  

This will round up our work with servers for now - but don't be fooled; there's a lot going on under the hood that we're not covering. It's a world of wonders, Express is.
