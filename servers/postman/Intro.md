This is less of a lesson and more of a quick tutorial on how to use Postman - a very useful tool for anyone working with servers.

  

Postman allows us to make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests to our heart's content, without having to set up a client at all. In fact, Postman _is_ the client.

  

So for starters, go ahead and [download Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps), then install it on your computer.
