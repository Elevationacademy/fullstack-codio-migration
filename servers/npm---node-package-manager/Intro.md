In this lesson we're going to cover [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - and how this gives us **tons** of power as developers.

  

As well as discussing what NPM _is_, we'll also talk about

-   How to install packages with NPM
-   The package.json file
-   The node_modules directory
-   The .gitignore file
-   Client vs Server packages

  

We'll also try out some useful packages to see some of the power we're gaining here:

-   Request
-   Moment.js
-   Validator

  

This will be a good one.

#### **NPM**

  

NPM stands for **N**ode **P**ackage **M**anager, and it gets installed by default when you install Node on your computer. It was developed in parallel to Node to help manage node's many packages.

  

A package is another term for a **module** - just a bit of code that someone has written that does something.

  

In short, **developers use NPM to install, share, and distribute code**.

  

In the developer community, people are always writing great pieces of code that someone else might want to use. In order to allow everyone to use their code, developers bundle up their code into a "package", then put it up on NPM to allow others to use it. Very communal.
