So now we can host our apps through a server, but the only way we know to access the server (either routes or files) is through the browser.

  

But of course, the browser is just making a GET request to whichever route we give it. And we know how to make GET requests with jQuery!

  

To put this to practice, we're going to create our own mini-Google-books-API:

  

There will be a simple input on our page, and a button. The user will be able to type an ID into the `input`, press the button, and then receive some data (from the server) about that book. We'll take this step by step.

The following section will be a video that shows this whole process, and then you'll get a chance to implement everything yourself.
