So what is localhost anyway? It literally means "this computer" - this should make sense.

In our `createServer` from before, _your own computer_ is the machine that created the server. So if we want the browser to access that server, it makes sense to direct it to "this computer", i.e. to localhost - the `3000` is just a [port number](https://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/port-number); not important for right now.

  

The difference between `localhost:3000` and `https://vovi.serveo.net` is that the latter is an actual address that _anyone_ can access, not just your computer.

Quite a lot of terms, but all of them important as we step into the world of servers. Don't worry if it hasn't all clicked yet, it will all start to make more sense once we start using [Express](https://expressjs.com/).
