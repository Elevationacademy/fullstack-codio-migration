To conclude, we have followed the following flow:

1. Figure out problematic scenarios
1. Find out what will happen in out code in this problematic scenario.
1. Catching the problem with an if statement or a catch clause, or in some other way.
1. Handling the error. In the server case we will return a relevant response with the right status code, and a detailed error message.
