Everything should be fully running now and working correctly.

Try the following scenario and see what happens.

Go into the inspection tab in your browser.

If you are using `Chrome` you should see a tab that is called `Application`.
Inside this tab we can see our `Local Storage`.

Inside our `Local Storage` our token (if we logged in successfully) should be there.

Delete it and try to request a resource (make a sound).

If it redirects you to the `Login` page, you have successfully finished the exercise.
