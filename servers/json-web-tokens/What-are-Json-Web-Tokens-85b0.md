JSON Web Token is a method used to share information between two entities, usually a **client** and a **server**.


Json Web token contains different **JSON** objects, these **JSON** objects contain data and information that needs to be shared.

JSON Web token is also signed using cryptography(hashing), this ensures that the JSON cannot be altered by the client or malicious party.

## Cryptography

**Cryptography** is the practice of making information secure by transforming it into a form that is unreadable without a special key or password. It involves using mathematical algorithms and codes to protect sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other confidential data from unauthorized access or theft. 

The purpose of cryptography is to ensure that only the intended recipient can access and understand the information, while keeping it hidden from anyone else who might try to intercept it.

In simpler terms, a **JWT** is like a digital passport that contains some information about a user or application, such as their name, email, and access permissions. It's a secure way of sharing this information between different parts of an application or between different applications altogether.
