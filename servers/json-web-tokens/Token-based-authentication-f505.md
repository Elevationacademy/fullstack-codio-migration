Token-based authentication is a way to verify the identity of a user who is requesting access to a system or application. Instead of sending a username and password with each request, the user first sends their login credentials (username and password) to the server, which then generates a unique "token" for that user.

The token is a randomly generated string of characters that is unique to that user and is typically valid for a certain period of time. The user then sends this token with each subsequent request to the server, rather than sending their username and password.

The server checks the validity of the token and, if it's valid, grants the user access to the requested resource. This approach is more secure than sending usernames and passwords with each request, as tokens can be set to expire after a certain period of time, reducing the risk of an unauthorized user gaining access to the system.

Overall, token-based authentication is a secure and efficient way of managing user authentication and authorization in modern web applications.
