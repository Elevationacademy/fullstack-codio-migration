We can also **alias table names in the** **`FROM`** part of our query.

  

This is mostly useful for shortening our query a bit, so we can write `tr.customer_id` instead of `transaction.customer_id`.

  

Try to **do this yourself** inside `/solutions/check_2.sql`:

  

Rewrite the query from the previous section, but now using the alias `tr` for the `transaction` table, `cu` for the `customer` table, and `co` for the `company` table.
