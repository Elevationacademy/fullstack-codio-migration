Now for the interesting part.

  

Inside of `/solutions/check_4.sql`, write a query that returns all the student names that have Foster as their teacher.

  

For this query, do **not** hard-code the teacher/student IDs - use their **_names_** (where relevant) and what you know about **joins**.

  

**Hints**:

-   Even though this is your first **many-to-many** query - it's still just the normal **join**s you practiced before
-   A simple `WHERE` join can work just fine
-   You will need data from all three tables
-   Use aliases (on the table names) to simplify your query
