# Intro

This short tutorial will walk you through the setup process of working with MySQL.

  

  

To work with MySQL, we first need to **connect to a server** that is hosting our database.

To do this, we'll install an extension in VS Code that allows us to connect with a local SQL server and execute SQL commands.

  

We'll be using MySQL version 5.5. The most current version has authentication not yet supported by node, so we'll be working with the last version to do so, 5.5.
