Go to this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/sql-intro-lesson-exercises) **fork** it, and then **clone** it.

----------

  

Inside the repo you've cloned you'll find several blank `.sql` files inside of the `/solutions` folder. For this first spot-check, you should write your query (and _only_ your query) in the `check_1.sql` file.

  

For example, this spot check will ask you to write an INSERT statement. Inside the .sql file, you should **only** write the **INSERT** statement, and not any **CREATE** code you had prior <ins>(you should have been coding along since the previous lesson to create the necessary SQL database and table that you need for the following exercises) nor an **SELECT** code you might use to check your **INSERT**s with.</ins>

  

----------

  

Write a query that inserts another deity: _Felurian_.

  

Her mythology is _Faen_, her power is _Persuasion_, she has no coolness level (she's beyond that), and her creation date is _0_. Only use the `VALUES`, without dictating which columns.
