Today we'll dive into the world of SQL - **S**tructured **Q**uery **L**anguage.

  

SQL is a language that allows us to write commands that communicate with a certain SQL-type database.

  

There are a few types of SQL databases such as MSSQL, Postgres, etc - but we'll be using **MySQL** - perhaps the most popular one in the world.

MySQL is known as a **relational database** - because we create separate tables (like Excel sheets) to store different groups of information, and those tables have relationships between one another.

  

However, we won't get into relationships in this lesson. For now, we're going to focus on the basic syntax.

In particular, we'll talk about:

  

-   Creating a table
-   Primary keys
-   CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) Operations
    -   Storing data into a table
    -   Querying data
    -   Filtering data in our queries
    -   Updating, deleting data

  

This lesson assumes **you have setup the VS Code extension and already connected to some MySQL server**.
