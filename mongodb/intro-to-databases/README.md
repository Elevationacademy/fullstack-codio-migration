# Intro

This short lesson will be a primer to our work with databases. In it we'll learn

-   A few common DB (database) terms
-   How to think about databases
-   Where databases fit in our app architecture

  

There won't be any exercises, but **these are important concepts you must understand** before you start working with DBs.
