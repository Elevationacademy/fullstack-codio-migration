So far our work with databases has been directly with the database - through the shell - we've been writing **mongo**.

But of course, interacting directly with the database doesn't help anyone if we want our app to manage a bunch of data... and that's where **mongoose** comes in.

Mongoose is a JS library that allows us to interact with our Mongo DB (i.e. write Mongo queries) **through our server** - in normal JS!

  

In this lesson we will see how we use mongoose, and specifically go over:

  

-   Setting Up Mongoose
-   Mongoose Schemas
-   Mongoose Models
-   CRUD operations with Mongoose
-   Mongoose in the Server
