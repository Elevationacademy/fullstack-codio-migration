Let's bring it all together:

-   Change your `.connection` to connect to a `computerDB` database instead
-   Create a `computerSchema` schema. It should have
-   A string `maker` (HP, Apple, etc)
-   A number `price`
-   Create a `Computer` model
-   Create a couple of instances
-   Save your instances to the DB
-   Check in your DB to make sure that it worked
