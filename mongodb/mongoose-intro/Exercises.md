Exercise 1
-----

Create a `post` route called `/person` in the server above that receives an object with a first name, last name, and age.

  

This route should save a `new` person into the DB.

  

Use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test this route, and your `/people` route to make sure the `save` worked.

Exercise 2
--

Create a `put` route called `/person/:id` that receives a required param of `id`. Use this `id` to update that person's age to 80.

  

Again, use Postman and your `/people` route to test.

Exercise 3
--

Create a `delete` route called `/apocalypse` which removes **all** the data from your `people` collection.

  

The question is, are you brave enough to test this route?
