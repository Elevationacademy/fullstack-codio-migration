For this lesson, you should have a Mongo DB installed and ready to go.

  

We're going to go over the very basics of working with Mongo - this will be totally detached from the any JS server/client code for now - just **raw Mongo queries**. To reiterate: this lesson has nothing, _nothing_, **nothing** to do with JavaScript.

Specifically, we're going to cover the following:

  

-   Terminology
-   DB CRUD Operations
-   Mongo Array Commands
-   Filtering
-   More DB Operations (sort, count, limit)
-   Aggregations (Optional)
