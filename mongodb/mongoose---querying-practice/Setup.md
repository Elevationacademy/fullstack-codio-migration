To get started, fork and clone [this git repo](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/mongoose-practice) and remember to `npm install`.

  

**Do not look at the** **`solutions.js`** **file** until you have to.

  

The main logic is contained in `server.js`, and you'll find all the questions at the bottom of this file.

  

You'll notice that the `BookModel.js` and `PersonModel.js` files are empty - you'll have to **fill these out as follows**:

  

**Book Model Properties:**

-   title
-   author
-   pages
-   genres
-   rating

  

Note that `pages` should be of Type `Number`, and `genres` should be `[String]` - i.e. an array of strings.

  

**Person Model Properties:**

-   hair
-   eyes
-   weight
-   height
-   salary
-   numKids
-   kids

  

The `kids`'s Type should be an empty array, i.e. [ ], the rest should be clear.
