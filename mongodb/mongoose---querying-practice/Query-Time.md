Scroll down `server.js` until you see the **Exercises** at the bottom of the file.

  

**Note**: you'll have to Google a lot. Check out Stack Overflow and Mongoose documentation to learn some new syntax and logic.

  

You have the basics, and a lot of programming is about learning new things - so take this as an opportunity to practice your Googling.

  

If you're super stumped, look at the `solutions.js` file, and learn from that for the subsequent problems.

  

Some specific things you'll probably need are:

-   `sort`
-   `limit`
-   `skip`
-   `and`
-   `exec`

#### **GOOGLING**

It might be frustrating at first, but Googling is an important skill. Before you ask an instructor your question, ask _Google_ your question.

  

Don't know how to do an `or` in Mongoose? Search `how to do or in mongoose` - guaranteed one of the top results will have what you need.

  

----------

  

**Priorities:**
Do queries 1 & 2 from the 'Book' section.
Do queries 1 - 3 from the 'People' section.

  

_* If you've finished the queries above and have more lessons ahead, please head to the next lesson and get started. Otherwise do all the queries :)_

#### **GOOSE LUCK**
