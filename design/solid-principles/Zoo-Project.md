# Introduction
In our zoo, we have lots of animals. We would like to present some key-facts about each individual of them.  

Each individual animal should provide its name (might be specific like Simba or Rafiki, or a general one, say, Tiger-3), its species and the food it eats: the food type, and the daily quantity.

In addition, 
All the mammals also provide the duration of the pregnancy.
All the fish and sea-creatures also provide the lowest depth they can reach. 
All the birds also provide their wing-span.

For the scope of the exercise you can assume the following regarding the animals diets:
- A lion eats 6 kg of meat every day
- A whale eats 2000 kg of plankton every day
- A clown fish eats 3 grams of algae every day
- A goose eats 1 kg of seeds every day
- An owl eats 100 grams of worms every day

You can make other assumptions as well :)

Every day all the animals in the zoo need to be fed. We will take care of that in the next section.

# The Task
You should create the Zoo with the following individuals:
Simba - a lion
Nala - a lion
Willy - a whale
Akka - a goose
Hedwig - a snowy owl
Nemo - a clownfish
Marlin -  a clownfish

1. Create a zoo with the following animals, and print the details of all of the zoo animals.
1. The zoo should have a food supply to feed the animals. We will have a simulation of 2 weeks of feeding. You should feed all the zoo animals. In case a specific food runs out, you should print a message and refill the supply. You can use the default amount of 2 weeks feeding.

# Important Notes:
1. Pay attention to the design of the application. Plan ahead and try to follow the SOLID principles and other design principles.
1. Clean code - naturally we would want to keep our code clean and maintainable.
1.  Iterations - try to focus on the important things. You can make assumptions that will help you simplify the program. Sometimes it's better to have a minimal working version, before you complete all the details, and requirements.
