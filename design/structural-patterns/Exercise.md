Write an HTTP client facade.
Your client should be based on `XMLHttpRequest`.
You can information here: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_ajax_intro.asp
Your facade should provide methods that makes an HTTP request and returns the response to the client as a Promise in JSON format (support at least GET and POST).

You can test your program against any open REST api platform,
for example: https://reqres.in/
