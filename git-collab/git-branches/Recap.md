-   Branches are essentially a snapshot of our code in another place
-   Every commit we make is to a certain branch
-   Our master branch is our main line of clean code
-   When we want to make a new feature or fix a bug, we `checkout` a new branch
-   We make our changes, commit, and push to this branch
-   When changes are finished, we `checkout` our `master` branch and `merge` our changes from our feature branch back into our master
-   This is specifically for solo work, merging is a little different when working in a team
