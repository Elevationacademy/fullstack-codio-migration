Bit Bucket has [excellent git tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) - we highly recommend reading through this, especially if Git has been confusing to you.

  

[Here's a good cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/git-cheat-sheet/), though we recommend writing one in your own words.

  

You can also check out [learngitbranching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) for a visual walk through of git operations that have to do with branching. This one is a bit more tedious, but also very thorough if you need extra practice.
