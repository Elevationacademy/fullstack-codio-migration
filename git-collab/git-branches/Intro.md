In this lesson we'll be uncovering the magic behind git branches and branching. We'll discuss:

-   What branches are
-   Why we need branches
-   Proper branching methodology
-   Branching commands

  

This lesson has a strong theoretical basis; the major point here is **understanding when and how to use branches** in version control (specifically git). So let's make like a _tree_ and... get on with the lesson.
