You already know a branch. Maybe the most important branch: `master`

  

This branch is usually the **main code base**, also known as the **production branch** - i.e. the code that our users will interact with.

  

For a technical definition, Bit Bucket explains branches well:

  

_A branch represents an independent line of development. Branches serve as an abstraction for the edit/stage/commit process. You can think of them as a way to request a brand new working directory, staging area, and project history._

In other words, when you create a _new_ branch (aside from `master`), it's like **a copy of the project (all the code) at that point**, in another place. In this branch you can add new features, edit, change the project, and commit your changes to this _branch_ without affect the original code.
