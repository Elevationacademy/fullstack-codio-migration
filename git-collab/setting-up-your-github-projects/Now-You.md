Go to one of your projects and:

1.  Add a short description at the top (and link to deployed version if you have one)
2.  Add some topics
3.  Add a readme file with screenshots

  

*You can see a good example of a Github project [here](https://github.com/danbrud/crm).

  

----------

  

Edit your profile and add an image, description of yourself, and modify your top projects.

  

Note: you should constantly be updating this as you add new projects to Github.

  

----------

  

Now your Github is ready to go :)
