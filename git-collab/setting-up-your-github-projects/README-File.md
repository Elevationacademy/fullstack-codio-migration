In every project, you can create a _readme_ file where you can specify any information about a project. Some of the points you want to include are:

-   What is the project - a description on what it does and how it works (and a link to a deployed version if you have)
-   How to run the project - an explanation of how someone would download and run your project on their local machine
-   Screenshots - a screenshot for every page of the project (and a short explanation of what the user does on that page)
-   Tech stack - what technologies you used in this project
-   Todo - a list of features you would like to add to the app in future versions

  

If you have a readme file in your repo Github will automatically display its content underneath the files of the project like this (the readme content is what's in the red box):

---------- 

You can create a readme by doing the following:

-   In the root directory of your project (on your local repo) create a new file called `README.md`
    -   'md' stands for Markdown.
    -   Markdown is a markup language with plain text-formatting-syntax. It is similar to HTML where you can build content of a page
-   You can go to [this link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to find a cheatsheet on how to write in markdown - it is fairly simple to learn.
-   `Commit` and `push` your code. Github will understand anything with the name `README.md` should be displayed under the project files.

  

Pro tip: While writing markdown in your readme file in VS Code, you can click on the little button with the magnifying glass at the top write corner of the screen. It will then open a tab in VS Code with a preview of how it will look in Github. This will help you style your page better when first starting to write markdown.
