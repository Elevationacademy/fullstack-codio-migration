At the top of every Github repo, there's an area for a project description. This is a great place to write one or two sentences about what the project is and who it's meant for. Really sort of a one liner.

  

In order to edit the description, click on the edit button as shown bellow:

While adding a description, there is also a text box to add a website for the repository (as shown below). If you've deployed your project (to heroku) it is a good idea to add the link here.

Github also allows us to add tags or topics to a project. This is a great way to quickly show what type of technologies you used in your project.

  

In order to add topics to your project you should:

-   Click the 'Manage topics' button
-   You can start typing the technologies you used (type as many as you'd like - it will autocomplete for you)
-   To complete, click 'Done'
