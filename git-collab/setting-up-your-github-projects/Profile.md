It's a good idea to edit your profile to highlight the important things you want people to see.

Here's what you should do:


1.  Click on the small button at the top right hand corner of your screen. A dropdown will pop up, click on "Your profile".
2.  On the profile page, click on the 'avatar' on the left side of the screen and upload your own image or avatar.
3.  Below your name there's a 'Edit profile' button, click on it and add a short description of yourself. Your description can include the technologies you know, a fun fact about yourself or anything you want to share.
4.  One of the most useful things you can do on your profile page is to customize your 'pinned' repos. This allows you to choose what project others see first when visiting your profile. To this click on the 'Customize your pins' button on the right side of the screen as shown below:

5.  It will then open up a popup where you can mark up to 6 topics which you want to showcase on your profile. Heres a screenshot:
