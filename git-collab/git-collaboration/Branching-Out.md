Now that you both have a local version of the repo, you're going to branch out.

  

**Partner A**, you're going to create a new branch* called `front-end`

  

**Partner B,** you're going to create a new branch called `back-end`

###### ***Reminder**: `git checkout -b _branch-name`

  

Now that neither of you are in master, you can get to work! Per the names of your branches,

-   **Partner A**
    -   Add in a `style.css` and a `main.js`
    -   Put a secret message on the page
-   **Partner B**
    -   Add in some server boilerplate in the `server.js` file
    -   Host the `dist` folder
    -   Create a `get` route called `/message` that sends a secret message
