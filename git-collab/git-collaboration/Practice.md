We'll start with **Partner B:** `add`, `commit`, and `push` your changes to your branch.

Your last command should be `git push origin back-end`

  

Then, Partner B, go to the repository on github. You should see a new message that looks like this:

Go ahead and click the "compare & pull request" button. This will lead you to the pull request creation page.

Here, you should add in comments about what you did, though all of your commit messages are tracked with what you committed, so if you used clear, concise commit messages, you shouldn't have to say too much.

  

You'll also notice that github will tell you if it can automatically perform the merge into master (your base branch). It should be able to do this for you at this point.

**Partner A, go to the repo in your Github, and go to the pull request** (you can find it in the pull request tab of the repo). Go ahead and click "merge pull request". You'll be prompted to put in another comment if you so choose, and then you can **click "confirm merge"**.

  

You've just completed you first pull request! You'll now see this screen on partner A's computer

The pull request is completed, and you are prompted to delete the branch, which you should if you're not planning on using that branch again.
