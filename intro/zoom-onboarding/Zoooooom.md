Hi everyone!

  

Since we are going to be using zoom in some of our trainings, we've created this short tutorial that show a couple of important features for the student.

  

In particular, please note that you can:

-   "Raise your hand", and
-   Chat with others
--   Privately or publicly

  

Notice that the trainer will always receive a notification when you "raise your hand", but may not get to you right away as s/he is wrapping up an important point - but don't worry, your questions are important to us =]

  

Enjoy the video in the next section - we tried to keep it professional [üê¢](https://emojipedia.org/turtle/)
