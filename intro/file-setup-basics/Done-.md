Awesome! The important things to remember from this lesson are:

-   The commands for navigating via your command-line.
-   The commands for creating new projects and opening them in Sublime from your command line.
-   The "boiler-plate" HTML code and linking our CSS file.
-   Opening your files in the browser.

Write anything down that you think you may need to reference later from this lesson.
