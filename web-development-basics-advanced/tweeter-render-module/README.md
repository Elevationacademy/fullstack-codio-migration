# Intro

After Completing the Module part of the **M**VC ,It's time to **(partly)** bring our **Tweeter app** to life!

  

If you've got your whole **Tweeter logic module working well** - great. Keep that.

if you did not **complete** it, thats okay! ðŸ˜„ you can use the following instead for now, since we're only going to deal with rendering and nothing dynamic yet:
<details>
<summary>Tweeter Logic</summary> 

```
const Tweeter = function () {
    const _posts = [
        {
            text: "First post!",
            id: "p1",
            comments: [
                { id: "c1", text: "First comment on first post!" },
                { id: "c2", text: "Second comment on first post!!" },
                { id: "c3", text: "Third comment on first post!!!" }
            ]
        },
        {
            text: "Aw man, I wanted to be first",
            id: "p2",
            comments: [
                { id: "c4", text: "Don't wory second poster, you'll be first one day." },
                { id: "c5", text: "Yeah, believe in yourself!" },
                { id: "c6", text: "Haha second place what a joke." }
            ]
        }
    ]

    const getPosts = () => _posts

    return {
        getPosts: getPosts
    }
}
```

</details>
<br>

Having the getPosts function is enough for this part, because that's all our rendering module will **require**. (we Do **NOT** need anything more than that)

Also, here is some HTML (add it to your **tweeter** folder) you should use - it's nothing exciting, and we won't be changing it throughout this project:
```

    <title>Tweeter</title>
