Add the following inside of the body of your index.html:
```
<h1>Hello, change me to blue please!</h1>

<div class="red-div">Please turn me red!</div>

<ul><li>Turn this li to green!</li><li>Turn this li to pink!</li>
</ul>
  
<div id="brown-div">Turn me brown!</div>
```
  

Use jQuery to select and edit the elements according to the instructions - remember that you can use the same selectors as CSS if you need.
