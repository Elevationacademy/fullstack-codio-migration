jQuery also gives us an addClass method - it takes one parameter, the class name.

-   Create two divs in your HTML
--  One with an ID of b1 and the second with an ID of b2
-   Target each of the divs and use the addClass property to add the class box
-   In your CSS file, define some styling for .box

  

You should see both boxes come to life.
