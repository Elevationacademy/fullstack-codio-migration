We remove things in jQuery simply.

This code will remove all ps from the page:

  
```
$("p").remove()
```
  

Or, we could be more specific and only remove ps with a certain class:

  
```
$("p").remove(".brown")
```
  

Try this out and relish the sweet and succulent flavor of the remaining raspberry.
