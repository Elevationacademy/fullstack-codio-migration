Given the following, and only the following HTML:
```
<div id="blogs"></div>
<button>Post Blog</button>
```
  

-   Write a listener that appends a div with a class of blog to the blogs div
--   Each div should have some text inside of it - it will be the same text each time
-   Write another listener that changes any element with a class of blog to have the text "blargh"
--   Use jQuery's [text](http://api.jquery.com/text/) method to change the text inside an element
