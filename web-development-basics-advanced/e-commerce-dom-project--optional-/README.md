# Description

The goal of this project is to create a simple e-commerce website. This can be a little challenging with your current knowledge, so take it slowly, read through all of the instructions before you start, and use Google :)

  

The site should have a navigation bar with 3 buttons:

1.  `About Us` - when clicked there should be some HTML rendered with some information about the website (feel free to get creative)
2.  `All Products` - when clicked it should render different HTML on the page which displays a list of all the products
	-  Each product should also have an add to cart button.
3.  `Cart Page` - when clicked it should render new HTML to the page which will display all items that are already added to the cart (here items can have a `delete` from cart button)

  

Note: You can use modules, but don’t need to if you’re not sure how.

  

Additionally, feel free to be as creative as you want. The idea is to explore and challenge yourself. You don’t necessarily need to add all the features or go exactly according to the instructions.

  

Good luck!
