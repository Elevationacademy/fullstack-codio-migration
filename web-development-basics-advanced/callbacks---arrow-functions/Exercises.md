## Exercise 1 - Callbacks


_ï»¿* If you're tight on time, please make sure to complete exercise 1, 2, 4, 5 before moving to the next lesson. Otherwise take a stab at all of them :)_

  

----------

  

Write a function pushPull that takes one argument - a function - and invokes that function:

  

  
```
const push = function () {
  console.log("pushing it!")
}

const pull = function () {
  console.log("pulling it!")
}

pushPull(push) //should print "pushing it!"
pushPull(pull) //should print "pulling it!"
```

## Exercise 2 - Callbacks

You can get the current date/time in Javascript by writing: const time = new Date().

Create a function called getTime that takes one parameter - a function - then calls it with an argument.
```
const returnTime = function (time) {
  alert('The current time is: ' + time)
}

getTime(returnTime)
```
  

Note that returnTime receives a parameter! So when we call it from getTime, make sure to pass the argument.

## Exercise 3 - Callbacks

Given the following code, what error do you get? Write the missing part to make the code work:

  
```
const displayData = function (alertDataFunc, logDataFunc, data) {
  alertDataFunc(data);
  logDataFunc(data);
};

displayData(alert, logData, "I like to party")
```
  

**Note:** do not change any of the code above. You only need to add something to make this work. Remember, alert is a built-in **function** in JS.

## Exercise 4 - Arrow Functions
Create an arrow function that receives three parameters and returns their sum - it should be one line.

## Exercise 5 - Arrow Functions

Create an arrow function called capitalize that receives any string, and returns it with proper capitalization:

  
```
capitalize("bOb") // returns Bob
capitalize("TAYLOR") // returns Taylor
capitalize("feliSHIA") // returns Felishia
```
  

It can be one line ;)

## Exercise 6 - Arrow functions

Given the following:

  
```
const determineWeather = temp => {
  if(temp > 25){
    return "hot"
  }
  return "cold"
}
```
  

Create a one-line arrow function called commentOnWeather that takes one parameter, temp. It should call determineWeather and return the concatenation of "It's " and determineWeather's output:

  
```
commentOnWeather(30) //returns "It's hot"
commentOnWeather(22) //returns "It's cold"
```

## Exercise 7
```
const explode = (lightFunc, soundFunc, sound) => {
  lightFunc()
  soundFunc(sound)
}
	
const shineLight = () => document.getElementById("box").style.backgroundColor = "yellow"
	
const makeSound = sound => alert(sound)
	
explode(shineLight, makeSound, "BOOM")
```
  

  

Study the code in the image above, think about what you expect to happen, and then complete the HTML to make the code work.

  

  

----------

  

# **const** **done = ( ) =>** **true**

We'll see more uses for arrow functions in future lessons (though it's great practice to start implementing them now where you can), and callbacks will become very important pretty soon. So nice job on getting here!
