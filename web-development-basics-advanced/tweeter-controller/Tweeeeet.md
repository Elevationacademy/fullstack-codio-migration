Congratulations, you've built Tweeter! Revel in the greatness of your app-building capabilities.



On a more serious note, you should appreciate the power of modules more now.

You wrote all three parts of Tweeter yourself (logic, render, event-handling) - but because it's so modular, you could have easily split this task between three people!



If you define everything correctly ahead of time (what does the renderer receive, what logical operations are available to the event handlers?) - then you can break big projects down into sub-tasks and work much more efficiently.



Think about this. It's awe-some.
