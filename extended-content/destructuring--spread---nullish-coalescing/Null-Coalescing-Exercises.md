## Employees Filter 

In a high tech company they are given an array of their Employees , the HR Staff needs to find which employees have null or undefined data. **Using the Nullish Coalescing Operator** print out the names of the employees that having missing data.


```js
let employeesArr = [
  { name : "Joey" , id: 1 , age: 26},
  { name : "Lily" , id: null , age: 24},
  { name : "Alice" , id: 7 , age: null},
  { name : "Sam" , id: 8 , age: 24},
  { name : "Ray" , id: null , age: null}
  ]
```
