## The Factory Mistake

In a factory there was a big mistake! an **overlap** has occurred in the packaging 

🥦 🥬 🍗 🥩 🍖 🥒

the factory is supposed to pack all the meat ingredients into one array and the vegetables into one

This is how the arrays usually look like!
```js
let meatArr = ["beef","chicken","rabbit"]
let vegetableArr = ["carrots","potatoes","lettuce"]
```

and currently it looks like this now!

```js
let meatArr = ["beef","chicken"]
let vegetableArr = ["rabbit","carrots","potatoes","lettuce"]
```

using the **Spread** operator , make sure all the ingredients are in the correct spot

## The Torn Passport

Ofri was about to board to the Europe, however she found out her passport was torn into two **Objects**

```js
var firstPiece = { id: 101, name: 'Ofri' }

var seoncdPiece = { country: 'Israel'}

```

You need to help her glue all her pieces togather into one **new** object
