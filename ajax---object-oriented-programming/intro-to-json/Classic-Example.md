Here's a sample JSON document. You are sure to run into a similar example at some point in your programming career:

  
```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Roxanne",
    "email": "rox@anne.com",
    "vip": true,
    "address": {
      "country": "Greece",
      "city": "Athens"
    },
    "itemsPurchased": [3112, 988, 7001]
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Terrance",
    "email": "trance@yahoo.com",
    "vip": false,
    "address": {
      "country": "Greece",
      "city": "Rhodes"
    },
    "itemsPurchased": [155, 2412, 4242]
  }
]
```
