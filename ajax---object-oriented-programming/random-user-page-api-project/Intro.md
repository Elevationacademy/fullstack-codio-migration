Now that you know how to request data from APIs and use Handlebars.js to render data on a page really easily - it's time to put your skills to work!

  

You'll be making a Random-User-Page-Generator. What exactly is a Random-User-Page-Generator (or RUPG for short, pronounced _ruh-pa-geh_)? It's essentially a Facebook profile page, filled with content taken from APIs and generated with different data at the click of a button.

  

You'll be using APIs, jQuery, Handlebars, Promises and of course creating it all in OOP. Are you Excited? Great, because RUPG is a multi-million-dollar-application just waiting for you to create it!
