**1.** Render the pokemon name on your page in "Proper Case" ("Pikachu" instead of "pikachu")

-   Hint: Create your own Handlebars Helper to do this.

  

**2.** Add in two more buttons - a "Save User Page" button and a "Load User Page".

  

-   Your "Save User Page" button should save a snapshot of your current user to local storage
-   Your "Load User Page" button should load the user that you saved and render the exact user page back on the page - that means the same user, the quote, pokemon, meatText and friends they came with.

  

**2.1** Save multiple users

  

-   Edit the object you're saving in Local Storage to be a users object. You'll be adding each user you want to save to this object.
-   Add a drop-down menu with the list of saved users. Now, when you click on the "Load User Page" button, it should load the saved user you select from the drop-down menu
