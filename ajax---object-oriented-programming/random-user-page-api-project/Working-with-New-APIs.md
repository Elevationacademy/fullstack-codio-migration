Part of your work as a developer is to explore and understand new APIs - so if you can't figure out how to get what you want out of an API - **read the documentation**! Remember, when you make a request to an API you're playing by their rules and each API is different!

  

Strong suggestion: these are all pretty straightforward APIs, so you can test them out using Google (or any browser) - just paste the API link as a URL and you'll be able to see exactly what data returns, which keys it has, etc. Great starting point.
