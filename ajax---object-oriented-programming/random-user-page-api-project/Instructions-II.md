Get started by **forking** [this repo](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/userPage-API-Project-Student). It contains the starter template of what needs to be done in the project.

  

**Note:** _You are mostly on your own with the following instructions. If you need extra help you can checkout_ [_this README_](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/fs-bootcamp-project-full-instructions/tree/master/RUPG) _file for some more in depth instructions._

  

Let's go through each part of the project and outline your requirements:

  

**Renderer**

-   Your Renderer is a _class_ which should render each section of the user page through Handlebars (and jQuery).

  

**HTML**

-   Should consist of your Handlebars scripts
-   Hint: you can have multiple scripts if you need.

  

**APIManager**

-   Your API Manager is a _class_ that should make all the API requests & update the data object in the constructor

  

**main.js** (your controller)

-   Here you should:
    -   Use the instances of your classes with MVC principles so that:
        -   When the user clicks the **Generate User** button, you should use your apiManager instance to get all the data and display it using **Promises**
  

We've filled in all the CSS for you, so no need to bother with that - but it's worth checking to see that you're using the same classes and IDs!

  

Alternatively, if you would like a design-challenge, get rid of the whole CSS and do it on your own ;)
