#### **FLAT UI COLORS**

  

The "Flat" design trend is something that is prevalent in most modern web-apps/pages these days. Fittingly there are also colors that go well with this design.

  

The [Flat UI Colors](https://flatuicolors.com/palette/defo) website does a nice job of giving you a collection of really nice, flat colors to choose from. Just click whichever one you want and it will be copied to your clipboard.

  

But once you find a nice color, you have to _match_ it with other colors...

#### **COLOR SCHEME GENERATOR**

  

If you've got a color you really want to use, but don't know which colors go with it, give [this site](https://coolors.co/) a whirl - it's pretty intuitive, and very useful.

#### **STEAL FROM OTHERS**

  

  

What if you can't think of a good starting color? Or you're just looking for inspiration?

  

The best artists are those who steal! Even [Pablo Picasso](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2013/03/06/artists-steal/) agreed.

  

To that end, if you're totally stumped, check out [this website](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/) (or any other website you like) for some inspiration. The link shows 50 templates with great color matches.

  

Remember that in general **you should limit your colors to 4 main ones at most, 3 is usually better** - more than that and your site starts to look messy.
