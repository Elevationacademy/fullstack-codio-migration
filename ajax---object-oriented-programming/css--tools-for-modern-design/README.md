# Intro

This isn't so much a lesson as much as a resource for several good tools you should be aware of and using in your projects.

  

Now, this isn't a UI (user interface) or UX (user experience) course, but we should be able to make something that looks reasonably good, and there are simple tools out there for that. As such, it is beneficial to learn them.

  

In particular, we will cover:

-   Font-Awesome
-   Flat-UI Colors
-   Color Scheme Generator
-   Website Color Scheme
-   Google Fonts
-   Design Tips
