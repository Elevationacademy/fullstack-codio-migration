Again, this is not a UI/X course, but here are some general tips to make your site look more modern:

  

-   Stick to a few colors across your website (different shades of the same are okay)
-   Have a consistent design throughout your pages
-   Stick to at most three fonts - but if you have separate fonts, make them for separate purposes (form, content, etc)
-   Fill up your page - do not leave a lot of empty space, unless it is intentional
-   This generally means you want to center things
-   Or have them spread across the page
-   Align elements nicely, don't let them be jagged across the page

  

And here is [another great source of inspiration](https://speckyboy.com/flat-web-design/), though you'll have to be clever about stealing the colors from here.
