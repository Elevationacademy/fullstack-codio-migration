For the thirtieth time, a class is a blueprint. So much so that we can use a [class diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_diagram) to represent all of its properties and attributes.

  

In our context, a **class diagram** belongs to the [Unified Modeling Language (UML)](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/uml-unified-modeling-language/what-is-uml/)conventions of describing what an object will look like.

  

A simple class diagram could look like this:

Notice how each attribute and method has a type description. Generally, methods will also have a short explanation of what the method should do.

  

For instance, in the above we could make the diagram more elaborate by saying "pushes `name` to `children`" in `birth`'s description - this would describe exactly what this method should do.

  

We use this models because anyone can create and understand them, which helps us communicate our business requirements more easily.
