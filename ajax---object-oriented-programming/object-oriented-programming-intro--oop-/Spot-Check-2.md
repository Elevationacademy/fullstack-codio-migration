Create a `Human` class.

  

It should have three properties: name, age, and isFriendly - a string, number, and boolean.

  

Then, create an instance of a human, and print out all its properties.

  

See the solution [here](https://codepen.io/ElevationPen/pen/qzWodE?editors=0010).

  

**Note:**

  

The way we've defined our class, you can **not** do something like this: `Animal.name` - this doesn't make sense because `Animal` doesn't have its own name; it merely describes what properties each animal instance _should_ have.
