create a `Vehicle` class.

  

It should have the following number properties:

-   `x`
-   `y`
-   `speed`

As well as a `getInfo` method. For now, this method should just print "Cars are great"

  

See the solution [here](https://codepen.io/ElevationPen/pen/xoKWVx?editors=0010).

  

We'll be using this class in a bit.
