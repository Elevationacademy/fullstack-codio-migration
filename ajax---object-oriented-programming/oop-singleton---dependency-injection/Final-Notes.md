As we said in the beginning of the lesson, Singletons and DI are just ways of working. They're not required but they can help improve your code.

  

That said, they should **not** be used all the time. Ask yourself why you're using Singletons or DI before you do - does it make sense to do so?

  

No exercises for this one, but certainly good to know.
