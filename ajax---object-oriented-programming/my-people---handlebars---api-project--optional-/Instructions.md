Go ahead and use [this API](https://randomuser.me/) to grab some fake user data (you'll need the name and email).

  

Then, using Handlebar's `#each` helper, display the `name` and `email` of each, and use their `id` (from the API) to add an HTML `id` attribute.

  

Finally, use CSS Grid's `grid-template-columns` and some of your own creativity to re-create the image at the top of this lesson: a grid of "cards", one for each person.

  

For extra flare, you can add a `:hover` [pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) to make each "card" change color on hover.

  

Also note that the blue underline under the email is also with CSS (assuming you don't use the `href` tag).
