## Instructions

Alright, now for **some practice**. Here are you instructions:

-   Create a simple input and button
-   When the user presses the button, it should display the text they wrote on the screen below the input
    -   As well, each piece of text should be added to an array called wisdom
    -   You should push the text as an object that looks like this: {text: "the thing the user wrote"}
-   On every other click (i.e, whenever the length of wisdom is even), save all of wisdom to Local Storage
-   When you refresh the page, you should load all the text from wisdom and display it under the input right away

  

Once you're done with that, complete the following:

-   Add a "Clear Wisdom" button that, when pressed, removes wisdom entirely from Local Storage
-   Add a little x next to each wisdom (on the HTML), that deletes _that_ specific piece of wisdom from Local Storage
    -   Might be useful to add an id to each piece of wisdom

  

That's all, you've got this ;)

#### **FINAL REMARKS**

  

Again, LS **does not** replace databases. But still, it comes in useful when we want to store things that we _don't_ necessarily want in our database.

  

Enjoy your Local Storage ~
