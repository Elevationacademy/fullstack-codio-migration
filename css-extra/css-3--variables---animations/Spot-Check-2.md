Using the same codepen from the previous example, add `<div class='catchline'>You're doing it.</div>` to the HTML, and the styling below.

  

You should animate this `div` to slide in from the left. Both animations (logo and catchline) should end at the same time.

```
.catchline {
  position: fixed;
  margin-top: 110px;
  font-family: Trebuchet MS;
  color: #2c3e50;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
