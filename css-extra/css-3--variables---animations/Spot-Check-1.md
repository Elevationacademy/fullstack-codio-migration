Go to [this codepen](https://codepen.io/ElevationPen/pen/oJZVQz) and update the CSS to use variables where necessary - give them reasonable names.

  

**Note:** variables are _not_ just for `colors`!

  

Check your work with [this solution](https://codepen.io/ElevationPen/pen/XLbYKj?editors=1100).

  

**Note:** there is no hard-and-fast rule about when/where to use variables. It's meant to help you.
