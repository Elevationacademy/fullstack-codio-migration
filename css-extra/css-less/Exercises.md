    
There are, as we noted earlier, other nice features in CSS Less. You're highly encouraged to take a look at the [@import docs](http://lesscss.org/features/#import-atrules-feature) after these exercises, for example.
    
      
For now, let's practice _all_ the CSS we've _ever_ learned with the following exercises.
    
      
    
      
    
## Exercise 1
    
    
Recreate the following image using as much advanced CSS as you can. This is good practice:

You can use a different logo in the **Open an account now** section, or create your own using CSS.
    
Maybe throw a small [animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations/Using_CSS_animations) in there.
    
      
## Exercise 2
    
Recreate the following - you're encouraged/probably have to use [font-awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for some of these icons:

Don't forget to use [beautiful colors](https://flatuicolors.com/) in your work.
