Not everyone has a knack for design, and some clever people have done some clever work to make the lives of us simpletons a little easier.

  

In particular, a [team from Carnegie University](https://materializecss.com/about.html) has developed a CSS framework called **Materialize** which is based off [Google's Material Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design) principles.

  

In short, a **CSS framework** is a set of rules (i.e. pre-defined classes) we can apply to our HTML that easily give elements a nice styling.

  

For instance, check out the following example:

<iframe src="https://codepen.io/ElevationPen/embed/oOGzaB?height=265&amp;theme-id=0&amp;default-tab=html%2Cresult&amp;user=ElevationPen&amp;slug-hash=oOGzaB&amp;editable=true&amp;pen-title=Materialize%20Base%20Example&amp;name=cp_embed_1?height=265&amp;theme-id=0&amp;default-tab=js,result?height=265&amp;theme-id=0&amp;default-tab=js,result" width="100%" height="265" frameborder="no" scrolling="no"></iframe>

  

Notice that adding the three classes to an `a` element (`waves-effect`, `waves-lightand` `btn`) we've instantly created a nice button with a color, shadow, hover effect, centered text, and reasonable dimensions - all with **no CSS of our own whatsoever**.

  

This is exactly how CSS frameworks work - they give you classes you can leverage.

  

Notice however that **frameworks do not always manage positioning for you** - as such this is **not** a substitution for CSS Grid or other CSS you know, but rather another tool to use.

In particular, this lesson will cover the following concepts from Materialize, though it is **highly recommended you read through** [**the docs**](https://materializecss.com/) **yourself** - much better way to learn:
-   Brief note on setup
-   The "grid" system in Materialize (different from CSS Grid)
-   The Button component
-   Styling components with more classes
-   The Card component
-   The Navbar component
-   Overriding Materialize
