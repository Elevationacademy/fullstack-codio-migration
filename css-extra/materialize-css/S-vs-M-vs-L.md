In fact, the `s` in `s3` or `s6` stands for **small** - i.e. a "small screen size". So the previous code is actually saying "when we display this on a small screen **or larger**, make this `div` three columns wide".

  

To see what this means, add the `m12` class to the first (blue) `div` in the previous example (it should look like `col s3 m12 blue`) - now change the zoom/size of the screen and you should see the column sizes change - that's Materialize's way of being **responsive**!

  

_ï»¿You_ the developer decide what changes in ratios happen depending on the screen size.
