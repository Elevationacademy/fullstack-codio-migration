This is the fun part - now you get to juice this baby up with some real features!

  

<ins>Routing</ins> - Split the `Operations` and the `Transactions` to have their own view on two separate routes. You should be able to view your transactions on one page and complete operations on another. Make sure that after your Withdraw/Deposit you redirect to the `Transactions` route.

  

<ins>Breakdown</ins> - Create another route to display the sum of transactions for each _category_. You should display a list of categories and the sum of transactions for each category.

  

<ins>Adding Color</ins> - Display each transaction's amount as either green or red, depending on whether they are positive or negative. For the **Balance,** display it in red if it is below 500 and green if it is above 500.

  

<ins>Styling</ins> - Spend some time on styling your app:

-   Think about how you want each page to look and draw it out on a piece of paper.
-   Translate that to your code. Use `LESS` / `CSS` / `CSS GRID`
-   Make your app responsive. Test it out on mobile and make sure it looks great. If it doesn't, add some media queries and make it look awesome!
