We need to create the following pages that will do the following functionalities:

**General feature**:
- Only functional components
- All the pages must be responsive
- The balance should be displayed on all the pages (if  `balance` is negative display it as `red` color and  if it's positive display it as `green` color.

**Inital page**:
- Display all transactions
- Display `withdraws` in `red` and `deposits` in `green`
- Each Transaction should have a button to delete it

**Operations**:
- Add a transaction 

**Breakdown**:
- Displays all the categories and the total amount spent/received in each.


you can use this Dummy Data to test out your components:

```js

  { amount: 22000, vendor: "Elevation", category: "Salary" },
  { amount: -7, vendor: "Runescape", category: "Entertainment" },
  { amount: -20, vendor: "Subway", category: "Food" },
  { amount: -98, vendor: "La Baguetterie", category: "Food" }
