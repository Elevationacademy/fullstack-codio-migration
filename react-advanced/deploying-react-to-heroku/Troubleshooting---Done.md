Pushing to heroku should work just fine now!

  

If you're still having problems, check out the logs but running `heroku logs --tail` in your terminal or by going to your heroku dashboard online and clicking "more" in the top right corner.

  

The logs may seem complicated at first, but don't get intimidated, read through them and it should help point to your errors.

  

If things aren't working, remember to check the console as well to see what kind of errors you are getting, you may see a route that is returning with a problem which will help give you a direction.

  

Enjoy having your websites online!
