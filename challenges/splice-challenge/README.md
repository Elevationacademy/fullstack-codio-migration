# The Challenge

Implement the array splice method.

You can read about it here:

[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice)

Try to be precise and thorough, read all the small details, and implement all functionalities.

You can use the following code to override the original splice method:

  
```js
const splice = function(){
    // write your code here 
}
```
  

Requirements:

1. Define parameters for the functions

2. Note that you need to pass the array as a parameter too!

  

Make sure the tests pass (you get the correct prints)!

  

Tests:

  
```js
// remove 1 element
let arr = [1,2,3]
splice(arr, 0,1); 
console.log(arr); //should be [2,3]

// add 1 element
arr = [1,2,3]
splice(arr, 0,0,0); 
console.log(arr); //should be [0,1,2,3]

// add 2 elements
arr = [1,2,3]
splice(arr,0,0,-1,0); 
console.log(arr); //should be [-1,0,1,2,3]

// replace 1 element
arr = [1,2,3]
splice(arr,1,1,55); 
console.log(arr); //should be [1,55,3] 

// delete all elements from index to end
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
splice(arr,1); 
console.log(arr); //should be [1] 

// returns array of deleted elements
arr = [1,2,3]
let deleted = splice(arr,1); 
console.log(deleted); //should be [2,3] 

// returns an array of the deleted element (1 element)
arr = [1,2,3]
deleted = splice(arr,1,1); 
console.log(deleted); //should be [2] 

// returns an empty array when no elements are deleted
arr = [1,2,3]
deleted = splice(arr,1,0,5); 
console.log(deleted); //should be [] 
```
  

  

If you want more challenge you can override the native splice function like this
```js
// overriding the native splice method
Array.prototype.splice = function(){
    // write your code here 
}
```
  

and then run these tests:
```js
// remove 1 element
let arr = [1,2,3]
arr.splice(0,1); 
console.log(arr); //should be [2,3]

// add 1 element
arr = [1,2,3]
arr.splice(0,0,0); 
console.log(arr); //should be [0,1,2,3]

// replace 1 element
arr = [1,2,3]
arr.splice(1,1,55); 
console.log(arr); //should be [1,55,3] 

// delete all elements from index to end
arr = [1,2,3,4,5]
arr.splice(1); 
console.log(arr); //should be [1] 

// returns array of deleted elements
arr = [1,2,3]
let deleted = arr.splice(1); 
console.log(deleted); //should be [2,3] 

// returns an array of the deleted element (1 element)
arr = [1,2,3]
deleted = arr.splice(1,1); 
console.log(deleted); //should be [2] 

// returns an empty array when no elements are deleted
arr = [1,2,3]
deleted = arr.splice(1,0,5); 
console.log(deleted); //should be [] 
```
 
Note: Place your final code in the `splice.js` file which is in the root folder here on Codio (see on the left side of your screen)

Good Luck!
