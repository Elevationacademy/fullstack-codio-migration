# Intro

In this assignment you will need to understand Python, read some code and add some features. 

Make sure to **fork**  the following repo and then **clone** it to your local computer.

You'll find everything you need to know in the `README.md`  file (in the repo).

Just go to [this](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/rand-sim-3a) link and follow the instructions there.

Extension: If you feel really confident about your coding and learning skills, you can go instead to [this](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/rand-sim-3) repo which is a harder assignment (also in Python)

Good Luck!
