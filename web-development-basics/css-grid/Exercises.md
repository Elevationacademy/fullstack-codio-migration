Again - start with the HTML first.

-   Think hard about what your container/items are going to be
-   Will you use `grid-template-areas`?*
-   What here is static, what is dynamic?

###### ***Hint:** You can have an element with a `grid-area` proprerty **and** a `display: grid` property together!

  

Take a crack at this yourself, here are some hints if you get really stuck.

[The main container's CSS.](https://codepen.io/ElevationPen/pen/zQeywg?editors=0100)

  

**Important:** do **not** use any position: relative/absolute or things like that to position/layout your elements - use CSS Grid only!

  

Of course, you can use padding and margin for minor stylstics, but **not** to say things like "this element should be to the right of this element".

**Free-Form Exercise**

You have some pretty powerful tools now with all you've learned about CSS + the Grid. As such, you will now put this power to use.

  

You will create **your own thing**. Use CSS Grid. Use normal CSS. Use [flat UI colors](https://flatuicolors.com/), and here are some [beautiful color schemes](https://www.canva.com/learn/website-color-schemes/) you can choose.

  

If you're super stumped with creativity, imagine that an artistically-challenged product manager asked you to create this:

Whether you're building your own thing, or the sketch above, here are some tips:

  

-   Sketch out what you want first with pen+paper
-   Understand what `div`s you'll need - what will your **containers** be, your **items**?
-   Start with basic layout first
-   Work incrementally
-   Make sure your files are connected
-   _Then_ make the overall layout
-   _Then_ color it to make sure it's what you expect
-   _Then_ add nested elements/grids
-   _Then_...
-   Be proud

  

Also, this might be a good time to re-visit past CSS things you've worked on, and see how much easier they become when using CSS Grid.

#### **EXCELLENT RESOURCES**

  

Firefox (the browser) has sponsored this [4 hour tutorial](https://cssgrid.io/), if you're really interested in Grid

  

Also, [this game](http://cssgridgarden.com/) is a fun way to practice CSS Grid.

  

And don't forget [this guide](https://alligator.io/css/align-justify/) we mentioned earlier regarding all the align and justify properties.

  

Finally, [this guy](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48847189/3147774) from Stackoverflow does a great job of explaining the "levels" of a grid container.

**Extension**
You now know Grid Basics. That is great. And useful.

  

As you know, learning by yourself is a huge part of programming. As such, using your existing Grid knowledge, go explore the following topics related to CSS Grid:

  

-   grid column start/end
-   grid-column
-   grid-row
-   max-min
-   auto-flow

  

These things are not hard, they're just new. You can do this =]
