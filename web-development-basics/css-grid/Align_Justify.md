# Align Justify

We saw earlier the properties `align-content` and `justify-content` - these are properties that can only be applied on Grid containers, or Grid items (or Flex, but we'll talk about that in a separate lesson.)

  

The gist is that `align` is for up-and-down positioning, and `justify` is for left-and-right. There are other similar properties: `align-items`, `align-self`, `justify-items`, `justify-self` - but these are best explored through practice instead of instruction.

  

That said, [this guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-align) does a wonderful job of explaining their differences.
