**THIS IS OPTIONAL**

Hello clever student. If you're here, you've finished working with functions and are looking **for an extra challenge** to dive deeper into functions - this lesson should **not** prevent you from moving on with the rest of the content.

  

If, however, you're done with everything else and would like to challenge yourself - have fun üòÅ
