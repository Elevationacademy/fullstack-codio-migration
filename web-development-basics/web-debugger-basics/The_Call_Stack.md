## The Call Stack

A more "advanced" feature of the **console** tab is the ability to see the "Call Stack" on the right hand side. Don't worry too much about what this is at the moment, we'll learn about `stacks` in a future lesson. For the moment, try to remember one thing: The "Call Stack" shows a nested path. The path is an ordered list of functions that represents how the code got to the point where it is currently paused. It's like, one function calls another function that calls another function etc. etc.

You can click any function in the call stack to view the values of variables within that function's scope. Don't worry, we'll learn all about `scope` next week and remind you about the Call Stack.
