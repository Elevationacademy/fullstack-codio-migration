# Breakpoints

There is a less obtrusive way to "pause" our Javascript than the "debugger" statement. Go ahead and remove the **debugger** statement from your **script.js** file and then refresh the webpage. In DevTools, at the top, click the tab that says "sources".

If you don't see your **script.js** file, you may need to refresh again or look for it in the menu on the left (under "file://"). Then, select the tab that says **script.js**. You're now looking inside your Javascript file.

On the left of the file you will see line-numbers. Click the number 2 and notice that it is highlighted with a blue tag. Now, refresh your page.

At this point it should pause your script at the highlighted point. We inserted a breakpoint on line 2 that works just like the "debugger" statement. To continue, press the highlighted play button.
