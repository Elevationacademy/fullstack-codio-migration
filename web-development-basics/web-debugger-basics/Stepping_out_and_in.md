# Stepping out and in

We've learned how to "pause" our code at a certain point, but often that is not enough to solve our bugs. We need to be able to move through our code line-by-line to understand what is happening and where the problems are surfacing.

DevTools has three ways to navigate through our code: by stepping over functions, stepping into functions and stepping out of functions. This means we can move through our code as it suits us; we can jump over parts that we don't need to investigate or we can choose to get more or less granular with our investigations. Don't worry if you don't understand this at the moment, the best way of learning how to debug is by debugging and, trust us, we'll be doing plenty of that in future!
