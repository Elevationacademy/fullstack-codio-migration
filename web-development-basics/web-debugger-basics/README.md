# Web Debugger Basics: Overview

A good craftsman knows his tools! In this lesson weâ€™re going to learn how to use Chrome Developer Tools (aka DevTools). Specifically, we'll learn how to do the following with DevTools:

-   Change the style of our webpage
-   Interact with our JavaScript
-   View errors in our code
-   Debug our JavaScript

DevTools was created for Chrome. Other browsers also have their own developer tools, there are even add-ons available, for example "Firebug" for Firefox, that give you even more cool features. Having said that, DevTools is pretty sweet so we'll just stick to working with that.
