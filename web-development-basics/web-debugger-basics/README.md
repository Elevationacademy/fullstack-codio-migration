# Accessing DevTools

To access DevTools open Google Chrome and do one of the following:

-   Type `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`i` (or `Cmd`+`Opt`+`i` on Mac) to open DevTools at the last tab you used
-   Click the menu (the three vertical dots) in top right of the browser, then select **More tools > Developer tools**
-   Right-click on any element on a webpage and select **Inspect**
-   Alternatively, if you want to open up DevTools on the **Console** tab then type Ctrl+Shift+J (or Cmd+Opt+J on Mac) to open DevTools on "Console" tab
-   Or for the **Element** tab, type Ctrl+Shift+C (or Cmd+Shift+C on Mac). This also toggles the "Inspect Element" mode if DevTools is already open

There are many [keyboard shortcuts](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/shortcuts?utm_source=dcc&utm_medium=redirect&utm_campaign=2016q3) available, and learning them will really help your day-to-day work-flow and save you time.
