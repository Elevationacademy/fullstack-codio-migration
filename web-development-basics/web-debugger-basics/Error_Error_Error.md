# Error Error Error

Whilst DevTools is open you can either click the **console** tab or press esc to view any errors (aka exceptions) you may have alongside a little description of each error.

In the above diagram we have a "TypeError" because we have not declared a function before trying to call it. There is no function to call; in other words what we are trying to call "is not a function" (it's nothing!). Clicking on the link to the right of the error opens the **sources** tab and highlights the line of code which caused the error to happen - in this simple case that's the line of the function call itself.
