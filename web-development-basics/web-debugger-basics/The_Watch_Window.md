# The Watch Window

When we move through our code we need an easy way to keep track of our variables. Luckily DevTools has the solution - **watch**. On the top of the right hand side of the **source** tab you'll see the "watch" window. We can use this to monitor the "value" of our code's variables and objects as we step through the code. Simply add something to watch by pressing the plus button and then typing in the name of the thing you want to watch (as it appears in your code).
