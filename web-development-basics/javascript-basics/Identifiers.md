# **Identifiers**

We have three main identifiers in JS:


-   **var** - you might see this every now and then (online or otherwise), but it's old and you shouldn't use it anymore
-   **const** - variables whose values will never change should be defined as const. This should be your default
-   Notice that when we use const we **must** initialize our variables since they can't change!
-   **let** - variables whose values can change should be defined as let

---

 For both `let` and `const`, once we define a variable with a certain name, we **cannot** use that same variable name again!

there are more differences between them that we will explore later on
