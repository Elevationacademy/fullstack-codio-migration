# Pre Install

Before we start with git, we recommend you to install a text editor to make working with git simpler.

  

By default git works with the built-in text editor Vim.

As many people find Vim not very friendly, we recommend to install one of the following options.

  

----------

  

**Windows users:**

install at: [notepad ++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/)

  

Or just google “Notepad++” and take the latest version.

**Mac users:**

install Atom editor: [https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/%C2%A0)

Or Sublime: [https://www.sublimetext.com/3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3)
