# Setup

First, letâ€™s open the cmd.

  

**Windows Users**

We recommend to work with git bash as your cmd, it will allow you to work Unix style (with Unix commands)

Of course you can also work with the built-in cmd

In the search panel type:

git bash

  

**Mac**

Type CMD + SPACE or click the magnifying glass in your top right corner to open up the "Spotlight" application and then just type "Terminal".

It should be the first result.

So, we have our command line open:

  


![.guides/img/PROD_A2397-0](.\img\PROD_A2397-0.png)

  

Note that each line in the cmd starts with a $

  

  

It is a standard that when we want a specific command to be typed in the cmd we will add the $ in the beginning:

For example:

```bash
ls
```
  

That means we want you to open your cmd and in it type just: `ls`

(without the $. The $ is already in your cmd!)

  

To make sure git is installed correctly, let's type:
```bash
git --version
```
  

you should see the git version:

  



![.guides/img/PROD_A2397-1](.\img\PROD_A2397-1.png)

It is very important to validate the actions that we do, especially when we learn something new.

Take that as a tip :)

  

Now we are going to configure Git. If you have never used git before, you need to do some setup first.

It is a one time thing, so let's do it. If you have git already setup, you can skip this part.

  

Run the following commands so that git knows your username and email.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your username"
git config --global user.email "your_email@gmool.mom"
```
  

For Example:
