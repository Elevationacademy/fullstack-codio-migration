# Intro

# CSS Position

So far, we've covered pretty basic HTML and CSS.

It wasn't the prettiest, but we're not shallow.

Today we will learn about the **box model** and start moving elements around the page using the following CSS properties

-   margin
-   padding
-   position
-   relative
-   absolute
-   left, top, right, bottom

You'll be playing around with a lot of HTML/CSS.

-   You **must** try all the things in this lesson, otherwise it will be useless and boring to you
-   If you want to keep some code but not delete it, you can **comment** it out
-   In VSCode, highlight the line(s) you want to comment out and press Ctrl+/ (that's a slash) - this will wrap your code in a comment and prevent it from being read by the browser.
