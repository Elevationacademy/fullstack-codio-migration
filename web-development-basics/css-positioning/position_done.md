So we've learned a lot, and now it's your time to practice, please proceed to the CSS Exercises lesson.

Note that a lot of things that we did in this lesson can be tricky/annoying/pedantic/trial-and-error when we're dealing with lots of elements - but fret not! We will learn better ways to create a general flow to the page and certain groups of elements. Stay tuned for the next episode of ~~Adventure Time~~ CSS Adventures!
