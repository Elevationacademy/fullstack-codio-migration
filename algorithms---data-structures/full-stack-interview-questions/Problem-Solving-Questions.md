In this part of the interview you will be asked to solve an algorithm problem. This portion of the interview is meant to evaluate how you think and how you approach problems.

  

Here's how to approach a question like this:

-   Start by repeating the question back to the interviewer
    -   This allows you to make sure you understood what the interviewer is asking
    -   This also buys you a few more seconds to think
-   Ask the interviewer some clarifying questions, this can include:
    -   Edge cases that you may (or may not) need to account for
    -   Any definitions you didn't understand from the question - for example if you were asked to determine if a string is a palindrome you can ask what a palindrome is if you don't know
-   Verbalize your answer:
    -   Start by giving the simplest answer (with a non optimal time complexity) - note the time complexity
    -   If the interviewer asks for an answer with a better time complexity, verbalize your new answer and note the time complexity
-   Now write your answer on the white board. When writing your answer:
    -   Use pseudo code - don't get caught up in the syntax
    -   If you need a helper method (which isn't the main point of the exercise) you can make one up and use it
    -   Talk out loud - say what you're thinking, the interviewer wants to understand how you think
-   Show a couple of examples of how your algorithm works:
    -   Walk through your answer with an input of your choice
    -   Show your algorithm working with edge case inputs
-   Hints:
    -   If you get stuck and need some guidance you can ask your interviewer for a hint
    -   If your interviewer provides a hint try to use it in your answer
