In this lesson we reviewed a bunch of interview questions but it's always important to keep on practicing. Here is a list of resources that can be useful when practicing for interviews:

-   [30 Seconds of Interviews Github Repo](https://github.com/30-seconds/30-seconds-of-interviews) - a list of questions (and answers) in JS, React, Node, and more
-   [How to ace an interview at Google video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKu_SEDAykw&feature=youtu.be)
-   [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) - algorithm questions to practice
-   [Leet Code](https://leetcode.com/) - also a great site with many problem solving questions
-   [Interview Questions for Developers Github Repo](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) - a list of a variety of types of questions

  

Good luck!
