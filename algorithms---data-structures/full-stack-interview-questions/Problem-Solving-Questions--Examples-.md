Here's a list of questions that can be useful when practicing for the _problem solving_ part of the interview.

  

-   Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
-   Given an array, find the int that appears an odd number of times. There will always be only one integer that appears an odd number of times.
-   How do you find the missing number in a given integer array of 1 to 100?
-   How do you find all pairs of an integer array whose sum is equal to a given number?
-   How do you check if two strings are anagrams of each other?
-   How do you count a number of vowels and consonants in a given string?
-   Create a for loop that iterates up to 100 while outputting "fizz" at multiples of 3, "buzz" at multiples of 5 and "fizzbuzz at multiples of 3 and 5.
-   Write simple .camelCase method for strings. All words (except for the first) must have their first letter capitalized without spaces. For instance:
    -   `"hello case".camelCase() => helloCase`
    -   `"camel case word".camelCase() => camelCaseWord`
-   Make this work:
    -   `duplicate([1,2,3,4,5]); // [1,2,3,4,5,1,2,3,4,5]`
-   Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word. Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.
    -   You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.
    -   If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.
    -   All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.
-   There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away. For example:
    -   `Pale, ple => true` - can insert a new character
    -   `Pales, pale => true` - can insert a new character
    -   `Pale, bale => true` - can replace a character
    -   `Pale, bake => false` - would take more than one edit to make the string identical
-   Find the largest word in a string (the input will be a sentence, you should return the longest word)
-   Create a function that returns the largest number in a range
    -   For example: `sumAll([4,1])` should return `10` because the sum of all the numbers between 1 and 4 (both inclusive) is `10`
-   Write a function that creates an array with a [fibonacci number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) until `n` where `n` is a parameter, for example:
    -   `getFibonacci(5)` should return `[ 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 ]`
-   Write a function that receives an array as an argument and removes any duplicate elements.
-   Create a function that receives a string and returns the reverse of what it receives. If the function receives `car` it should return `rac`
-   Write a function that receives a string as an argument and returns `true` if the string is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) and `false` otherwise.
-   Write a function that, given a string of characters, returns the character that appears the most often.
-   Write a function that, given a string of words or phrases, returns the number of vowels.
-   Create a function that receives an array and reverses the order of elements.
-   Create a function that, receives a string of words, returns a new string with the first letter of every word capitalized.
