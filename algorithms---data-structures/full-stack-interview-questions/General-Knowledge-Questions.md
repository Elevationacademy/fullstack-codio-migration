In this part of the interview you will be asked a few different questions about the technologies you claim to know. The idea here is that the interviewer wants to see:

-   How much you actually know
-   If you know the technologies in depth
-   If you can talk like a developer and communicate your thoughts clearly

  

How you should answer these types of questions:

-   Give a description on what the concept is - **make sure to use the correct technical terms**
-   Talk about it's benefits or how it relates to you as a web developer/when you would use it
-   Give an example - always end with an example of how you use it

**Example**

  

<ins>Example Question:</ins>

What is a closure in JS?

  

<ins>Example Answer:</ins>

In JS, a function can be nested inside another function. If the inner function accesses a variable from the outer function, the inner function is called a closure. Although nothing special is happening here in regards to the rules of scope, there is something special happening when it comes to variables in memory.

  

_Here you can talk about what happens after the invocation of the outer function and the fact that variables do not get released from memory..._

  

_Give an example of where you have used closures before, think React functional components and hooks..._

**How to practice**

  

To practice with general knowledge questions we recommend the following:

-   Try answering the question out loud in front of a mirror
    -   Sometimes the answer is clear in your mind but it's hard to verbalize
-   If you run into difficulty verbalizing your answer, look for the answer online
    -   Once you find the answer, try answering it yourself again out loud
