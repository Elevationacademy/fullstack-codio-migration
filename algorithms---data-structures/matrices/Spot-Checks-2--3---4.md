## Spot Check 3

Write a function called `get` that receives two parameters, `rowNum` and `colNum`, and returns the item at that position in the matrix.

## Spot Check 4

Now that you know how to access matrix items, it should be simple to print out a matrix formatted like this:
    
```
1       2       3       4
5       6       7       8
9       10      11      12
```    
      
Write a `print` function that prints the above.
    
      
    
**Hint:** use the string `"\t"` to space your numbers.
