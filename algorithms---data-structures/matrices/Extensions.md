Generally extension exercises are somewhat optional - but these one in particular are fun and very feasible. **You should do these**.

## Extension 1
    
Continuing with the tic-tac-toe game, write some validating code inside of `play` that prevents a player from playing on a position that's already been played.
    

## Extension 2

Write some more validation inside of `play` that prevents a player from playing twice in a row.
    
      
**Hint:** you might have to add some class properties to keep track of who's playing.
    
## Extension 3

When the game is over, reset the board to all dots.
