A matrix is a special kind of data structure that is built entirely of arrays. In fact, you can think of a matrix as a **two-dimensional array**.

  

A simple matrix in JS can be written like this:

```  
let matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
```

  

As you can see, this is nothing more than **an array of arrays**. We can say that the above is a **3 x 3 matrix**, since it has three rows and three columns in each rows.

  

We could, of course, use other data structures instead of matrices, but matrices come in very handy for certain two-dimensional data like board games/representing tic-tac-toe/pacman, etc.
