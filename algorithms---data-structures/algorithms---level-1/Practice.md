This lesson is filled with algorithms for you to solve. Of course, **do not use stack overflow** unless it's for syntax/general things - but certainly don't use it to look for the actual solution.

  

Guaranteed, **you will get stuck** - when this happens,

  

**Do:**

-   Draw some diagrams
-   Write out your "human" solution in words
-   Speak your solution out loud
-   Add another breakpoint
-   Add another console log
-   Consider [rubber ducky debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)
-   Talk _to one another_
    -   But don't hijack their solutions

**Don't:**

-   Bash your head against a desk
-   Lose faith
-   Tell yourself "this isn't for you"
-   Speak the forbidden words: "I don't understand anything"

  

Remember, you are not a lone wolf. This is a lone wolf:

Finally, for each algorithm you write, ask yourself **what complexity did you achieve?** And more importantly, **can you improve it?**

  

**And remember**, the purpose of all of this is to **train your programmer mind** - so no need to freak out of this is hard. It should be.
