The five complexities we've covered in this lesson - from best to worst - are:

  

-   **O( 1 )** - also known as **constant time** - no matter the size of the input, our operations are constant
-   **O( log(n) )** - this is **logarithmic** - the number of operations will be **log(n)** for any input size of **n**
-   **O( n )** - also known as **linear time** - our operations grow proportionally relative to our input
-   **O( mn )** - similar to **O( n )**, but with a another variable input that affects our operations
-   **O( n^2)** - also known as **quadratic time** - each time our input grows, the number of operations will grow exponentially; one of the worst cases possible

  

There are, of course, endless possible complexities: **O( n^3)**, **O( n Ã— log(n) )**, **O( mn^2)**, etc - but the above examples are a good foundation for understanding the rest.
