#### **PARTS OF A TREE**

-   Each spot on the tree is called a **_node_**
    -   A tree is a collection of nodes
    -   The relationships between these nodes are what define the tree
-   The first node in a tree is called the **_root_** of that tree
-   The nodes are connected by **_edges_**
    -   These are what define the relationships in a tree
    -   They are sometimes referred to as branches
-   The relationships between connected nodes are **_parent-child relationships_**, since a tree is hierarchical
-   Nodes without children are called **_leaf_** nodes
    -   These are the last nodes of a tree
    -   This is unbe_leaf_able!

  

Additionally there are two important aspects of trees to be aware of:

-   The **_height_** of a tree is the longest path from the root of the tree to any leaf
-   The **_depth_** of a node is the length of the path to its root
