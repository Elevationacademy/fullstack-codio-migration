There are a few reasons we're doing this:

  

1.  This is a fullstack course - there is no way you are getting out of here without knowing how to create a fullstack app
2.  Creating a fullstack app can be scary. It's a big endeavor - but once you do something many times, it becomes less scary
3.  The skeleton of the fullstack is not as interesting as the cool APIs/packages/logic you can use around it

    -   We want you to be 100% comfortable with the skeleton
    -   Once the basic fullstack is setup, you can go wild - and that's the real fun in coding; not the setup

4. Once you succeed,
    -   There are no more excuses
    -   You will feel good about yourself
    -   You will **truly** understand the full stack in all of its glory

  

So do it. Create a fullstack app in 15 minutes. Show yourself you can, because you can.
