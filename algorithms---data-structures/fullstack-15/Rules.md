Before you start the timer, you can have the following set up:

-   An `fs-in-15` directory open in your terminal
-   Your code editor open
-   An instance of `mongod` running in the background
-   Postman open with the GET & POST requests ready to test
-   The browser open at some `localhost:xxxx` address

  

You have 15 minutes to complete this project.

If the 15 minutes pass and your app is not fullstack as per the above requirements, you will **delete everything and start again, from scratch**.
