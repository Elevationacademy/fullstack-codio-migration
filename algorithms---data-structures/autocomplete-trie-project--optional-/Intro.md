In this project you'll be using a type of search tree called a Trie (also known as a prefix tree) to create an auto complete app!

  

You'll have to create an `autoCompleteTree` class and populate the trie based on an array of words. Then you'll write methods to search for words, and auto complete the prefix of a word.

  

In the end, you can create a UI to show your awesome autocomplete app!
