#### **INTRO**

  

There are a lot of different weather apps on the market. Most of them get their information from some API and display it in a way that looks nice on your phone or desktop.

  

You're going to be creating your own weather app with the full stack!

  

In this project you will write a client using OOP and MVC design, create a server, access an external API from your server, and save data to a database with CRUD operations.

  

Weather you're ready or not, let's go!
