So far, our app is static - I cannot refresh the weather unless I remove it, and add it back again. That's just poor functionality, so lets fix it

  

----------

  

#### **1. REFRESH BUTTON**

  

Add a button to each of the city's weather while rendering. This button will need to update the current data of a city.

#### **2. Current Location**

  

On page load, we want to show the weather for the user's current location. Check out [this resource](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_geolocation.asp) for tips on how to use the browser's geolocation api. 

You will be adding the current city as one the cities to be displaying data.

Great! Now the user always knows the weather in their location!

#### **3. LAST UPDATED**

Add to your project the ability to see the last time the city data was updated. this feature should be implemented in the frontend and backend
