That's it! The inner-workings of JavaScript are not that scary after-all. What about Node you ask? Don't worry as Phillip said, Node has it's own APIs that implements methods like `setTimeout`. That's how we can say NodeJS has a "event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient"!

  

If you want to write your own easy asynchronous code in NodeJS, then we recommend using the [async](http://caolan.github.io/async/) library. It's become an integral part of Node. We will talk about it in a few weeks; give it a try if you want, but move on if you don't have time.
