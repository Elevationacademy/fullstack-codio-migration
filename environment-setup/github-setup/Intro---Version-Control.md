### Git vs Github


**Git** is software that we'll install on our computers (aka we'll be installing it locally). Once installed we can start to use it for local version control ("local" meaning for the files on your computer). Local Version control will track the changes you make on your computer. But that's just half the story. We'll need somewhere to share the code so that many people can work on it at the same time.

  

Along with the local software, we'll use remote hosting site called **[Github](https://github.com/)** to help us in all our version control endeavors. It provides online storage for your files and it is based on Git so transferring files from your local Git repository to your remote repository on GitHub, or vice versa is really easy. Try not to confuse Git and Github.

  

-   **Git** is a free and open-source version control system. It exists on your computer (once you add it) and is primarily operated via the command-line.
-   **Github** is a company that provides a service. They use Git to provide cloud-based version control. More than that, they are a community that provides a bunch of useful tools and mechanisms to aid development work.

  

And if you were wondering, [alternatives](https://blog.idrsolutions.com/2014/03/top-5-free-hosted-version-control-sites-compared/) to Github do exist, but remember Github is used more than almost all of them.
