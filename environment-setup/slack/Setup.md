Slack is the App we will be communicating on.
it is a professional communication tool that is used in many companies.

Here is the link to install the [**Slack App**](https://slack.com/downloads/) on your machine

Make sure you use a slack name that is correct to your identity.
for example :

**Ameer Jamal** - correct
**secret phoenix** - not so clear who is it 
**msj1995** - cool gamer tag, but not for work!

After you setup your slack, please do join the [**ELEVATION** work space](https://join.slack.com/t/a-tech2/shared_invite/zt-26a58o3k0-Wz_kN22YxES5FEznM7ROSQ)

Once you are in the ELEVATION work space. please do join the [**bootcamp private group**](https://a-tech2.slack.com/archives/C062UU95CS3). we will be posting all important updates in there.
If the above does not work, please contact the Bootcamp TA.
