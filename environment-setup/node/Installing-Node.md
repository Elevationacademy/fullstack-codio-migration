#### **THE NODE SHELL**

  

Node has it's own [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) where we can write JavaScript and run it (using the V8 Engine). Open up your terminal (or command-prompt) and type node (once you have node installed, of course - make sure to open a new terminal).

Now, try out writing and running some JavaScript:

As you can probably tell, this is the Node equivalent of working in the browser's console - great place to test out small bits of code, but not much else.

  

To exit the shell, type CTRL + C.
