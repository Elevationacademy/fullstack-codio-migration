It is very important for us to be able to see you and interact with you. 

it is **Mandatory** to keep your camera open, unless there is a special situation and should be notified to the **Bootcamp Staff**.

Let's look at this picture

![](./zoom.jpeg)

notice that the Women on the **Left** is in a dark setting and we cannot see her face. so make sure you are sitting next to a light source or facing a window.

we want to have our face clearly shown. not too far away and not too close. like the women on the **Right**

here is another example of how your camera should not be

![](./zoom2.png)

the women is sitting too far away and we cannot see her face clearly.





so please make sure before you join the ZOOM call:

- the lighting is correct and we can clearly see your face
- the internet connection is working well and you are not lagging
- your camera is placed in a correct position where we see your face facing frontwards
