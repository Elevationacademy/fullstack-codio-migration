Before we start with git, we recommend you to install a text editor to make working with git simpler.

  

By default git works with the built-in text editor Vim.

As many people find Vim not very friendly, we recommend to install one of the following options.

  

----------

  

**Windows users:**

install at: [https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.9.html](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.5.9.html%C2%A0)

  

Or just google “Notepad++” and take the latest version.
