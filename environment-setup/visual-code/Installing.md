We will be working with Visual Code Editor in the bootcamp.
Theoretically, we could write our code anywhere so long as we use the proper file extension.
However, we will be using this editor - please [download this](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as well and make sure it's set up before the first day of class.

follow instructions on the website if you are struggling to install it. it should be very simple, but if you do struggle do contact the **Bootcamp TA**
