If you've ever been to Reddit (or pretty much any other website), you may have noticed that a page's URL can be indicative of the content on the page.

  

For instance, look at this **route**: https://www.reddit.com/

###### (not actually clickable; don't want to lose you)

  

The route in the above URL is just `/` - typically the default/main/home/root route for any page. No surprises of where the above should take you.

  

This route, however, is different: https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/

  

Still the same base - reddit.com - but now with a `/r/rickandmorty/` addendum - and if you go to that route then, of course, you'll end up on the _Rick and Morty_ sub-reddit, where discussions, theories, and ravings about the show are endless.

  

We're going to learn how to use React to make static routes, dynamic routes, and links for our own applications so that a user can hop around and get the full [Single Page Application](https://medium.com/@NeotericEU/single-page-application-vs-multiple-page-application-2591588efe58) experience.
