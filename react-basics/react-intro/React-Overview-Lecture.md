React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces on the web. It lets you create reusable components that can be combined together to make complex UIs.

React works by creating a virtual representation of your user interface called the "virtual DOM". This allows React to efficiently update your UI when things change without having to reload the entire page.

n simple terms, React works by creating a virtual copy of your website (called the "virtual DOM"), which it updates whenever your website changes. This virtual copy is very fast and doesn't slow down your website. When React updates your website, it only changes what needs to be changed, instead of redrawing everything from scratch. This makes your website run faster and more smoothly.
