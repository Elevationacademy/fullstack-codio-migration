## Intro

So far we've played with components a little - but we still haven't done anything very interesting. Remember,

  

-   We want to break components down to fundamental parts of the app
-   Components can be nested to create parent-child relationships, like normal HTML
-   Our components always return JSX
-   We must **export** and **import** our components accordingly

  

Now we want to start interacting between components. Specifically, we want to pass data from one component to another. To do this, we need to talk about **props**.
