# Intro

Hello, Reacters.

  

You're only at the beginning of your React journey but you've learned a lot.

  

Think about all the things you know:

-   Components
-   JSX
-   Props
-   State
-   Events
-   Proper data flow

  

So much power!

  

But power is nothing without practice, so it's time to put it together...

  

You're going to build **Pomodoro**.

  

Here we go.
