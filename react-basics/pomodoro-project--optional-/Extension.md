Add a `MusicRow` component.

  

This component should display four YouTube frames.

  

After choosing a video, it will be played when the break mode is started.

  

You should render the component in the `App` component and pass the following props:

-   `videoChosen` - which video has been chosen (to be played at the right time)
-   `shouldPlayMusic` - boolean that detects if the music should play or not

  

Feel free to add/modify this component with more props and function as you wish.
