**Reflix** is a movie rental app. It allows a user to browse a catalog of movies, and select some to rent, so long as the user has the **budget** for it. This is a very special kind of renting system wherein the money is returned to the user when the movie is returned.

  

The app has three main views: 
- the Landing Page
- the Catalog Page
- the Movie Detail Page.

You can click the following pictures to embiggen them.
