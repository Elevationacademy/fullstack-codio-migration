Hello, Reacters.

  

It's been quite the saga so far with **React**. You've learned basically an entire library!

  

Think about all the things you know:

-   Components
-   JSX
-   Props
-   State
-   Events
-   Proper data flow
-   Input
-   Routes (not built-in to React, but still very useful)

  

So much power!

  

But power is nothing without practice, so it's time to put it all together... _on your own_.

  

You're going to build **Reflix** - it's like Netflix ðŸ“º, but better and without actual videos.

  

Better because _you_ will have built it.

Here we go.
