**Final note about thinking in React**:

  

Notice that in both the "gallery" and "conversation" exercises, we had some property in state that determined the _state_ of our application.

  

In the "gallery" exercise, it was the index of which photo to display, in the "conversation" exercises it was which contact's conversation we wish to see.

  

In both cases, **we use** **state** **to literally represent the state of the application at any given moment** - _this_ is part of the philosophy of React, and how you should start thinking henceforth.
