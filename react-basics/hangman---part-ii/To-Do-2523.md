Once you have `letterStatus` object set up, you should do the following:

  

-   Pass `letterStatus` down as props to `Letters` and `Solution` - this will make sure all the components are in sync
-   Add a `solution` state to the `App`. The value of this is an object with two keys:
    -   `word` - the secret word, a string
    -   `hint` - the hint for the word, a string
-   Pass `solution` down to the `Solution` component
-   Add a `score` state to your `App`, and pass it down to the `Score` component

  

After all of that, you should:

  

-   Display the score in the `Score` component from `props`, instead of the hard-coded number
-   Display all the letters of `word` (from `props`) inside the `Solution` component (we'll hide them later)
    -   You should use the `Letter` component to display each letter*
-   Display the hint (from props) inside the `Solution` component
-   Use the Letters component to iterate over all the letters in `letterStatus`, and render **each** one using the `Letter` component*
    -   **Hint:** you'll want to use `Object.keys`

  

***Note** that the component that actually renders a letter on the page should be the Letter (singular) component.

  

The `Letters` (plural) and `Solution` components will _use_ the `Letter` component:

-   They should both pass down the relevant letters as props to `Letter`
-   `Letter` is only responsible for rendering a single letter, in a `span` element

  

The `.map` array method will be helpful.

  

If you've done it all right, your page should look like this, with _nothing_ hard-coded:
