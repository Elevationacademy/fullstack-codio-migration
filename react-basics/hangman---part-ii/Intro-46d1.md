It's time to wrap up our Hangman game.

  

All that's left now is to make it interactive. That is to say, when the user clicks a letter, it should react accordingly

-   If the letter is in the secret word:
    -   Every instance of that letter should appear in the solution section
    -   The score should increase by 5
    -   The letter should be "removed" from the letters section
-   If the letter is _not_ in the secret word, it should reduce the score by 20 and "remove" that letter as well

  

We'll be continuing on the same repo we used in hangman I and II, so open that repo and let's get goin!
