With that done, you should now update the score in `App`'s `state` accordingly, depending on whether the correct letter was selected.

  

Then, you should color the score differently based on whether it is high, medium, or low.

  

  

-   So long as the user has 80 points or more, assign the high-score class to the div with the score
-   If the user is between 50 and 80 points, assign the medium-score class
-   Below 50 points, the div should get the low-score class

  

Feel free to decide how to style each of the classes on your own (weâ€™d go for green-yellow-red colors, but hey, you decide!)
