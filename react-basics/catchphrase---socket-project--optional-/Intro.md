The _Catchphrase_ game is a multi-player game, where the players need to guess a secret word. The game needs to work in different clients, meaning live client-to-client communication (two separate browser tabs/windows).

  

Each turn, a player is presented with a secret word that they need to describe to the other player via chat. The second player then needs to guess what the secret words.

  

Guessing the correct word will win the player 10 points.
