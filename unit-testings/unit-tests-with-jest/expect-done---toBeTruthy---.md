Final words on testing: **on average, developers don't like to do it.** It is an important practice that often gets left behind.

  

**However!** If you ever get a coding assignment as **part of an interview** and you add tests - the employer will **love** you guaranteed (assuming you did the rest of the assignment well ;)

  

Ultimately, everyone has to write tests eventually. Big companies in particular, but also small startups that want to scale - so this is an important skill to have!
