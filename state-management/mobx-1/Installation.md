In this lesson we'll be using a gitHub repo (you'll get it's link and instructions in the "Creating a Store & Observables" activity).

But generally speaking, to install mobX in your React project all you have to do is:
1. `npx create-react-app my-app` like you already know
2. When in the project's folder, run - `npm install mobx mobx-react`
3. That's all - you're ready to go

Again, for this lesson you do not need to create an empty project, so you don't need to do that for now.
