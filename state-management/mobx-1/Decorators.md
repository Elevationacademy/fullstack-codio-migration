MobX used to work with javascript decorators. Currently, decorators are a [stage two](https://github.com/tc39/proposals#stage-2) proposal in javascript, which means they're not officially part of the language yet, but processors like [babel](https://babeljs.io/) allow us to work with them already.

  

Some of the videos in this lesson will mention decorators, but as MobX has recently moved away from decorators, the text in this lesson will show you how to work without them.
