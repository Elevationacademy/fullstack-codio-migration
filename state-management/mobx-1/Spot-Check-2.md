**Go back to your `App.js` file, and display each item from your** **`list`** **of items from your** **`groceryList`** **on the page**.

  

*Do this by mapping the data out to `Item` components. *

** Don't forget to pass the store as a `prop` to the `Item` components as well - we'll need that later **

**In your** **`index.js`** **add "corn" and "sombreros" to your** **`groceryList`**. Try changing the names of your items using the react dev tools, and watch them change on the page!
