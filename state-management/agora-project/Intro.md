Today, we're going to be building an Agora!

  

What's an Agora you say? Well, as Wikipedia tells us, in ancient Greece "the Agora served as a marketplace where merchants kept stalls or shops to sell their goods amid colonnades."

In layman's terms, we'll be building a simple shop using React and Redux. As the Agora manager, you'll be able to

  

-   Add new products
-   Set their price
-   Sell the products
-   Track the number of items in your store

  

No need for _agora_ phobia, let's get started!
