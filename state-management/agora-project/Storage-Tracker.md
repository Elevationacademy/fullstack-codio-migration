At this point you should be able to add new items to your Agora, buy items, and change the price of Items. You should see the number of items updating and changing as you go, amazing!

Now that we have our basic Agora set up, let's enhance it to use the full capabilities of the Redux-React partnership.


We're going to add a tracker to our store to see how many Items are in our store at all times. 

Good Luck!
