We've seen the basic functionality that the MobX + React combination can bring us, through `observable`, `observer`, and `action`. Now, let's go more in depth in the world of React + MobX!

  

This lesson will cover:

-   `computed` values
-   `Provider`
-   Injecting a MobX store into a React component
-   Using multiple MobX stores
-   Binding input values with MobX

  

To start with fork and clone [this starter repo](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/mobx-2-lesson-exercises-updated). It's the set up for a simple reservations manager. We'll go over the code in it and add on to it!
