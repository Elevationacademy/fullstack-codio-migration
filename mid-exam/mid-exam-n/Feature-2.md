The Feature that we will be adding to the Project is **Giphy'fying your Pictures! ‚≠ê**

![alt text](.guides/img/cat.gif)

Now that we want to alive your code!
You need to replace to the picture of the recipe with a **Gif**!

meaning now instead of a picture you see will a gif!

Video:
<video width="640" height="360" controls>
  <source src=".guides/img/f2-1.mov" type="video/mp4">
</video>

so you will need to implement the following:
- When sending the data with the server, replace the image before hand with a gif related to the recipe.
- Add the keyword "Food" to the search to ensure a more related result.

**Important :**
- do notice that the array that returns from the server (of all the recipes) will contain the gif instead of the image. 


**Notice :**

Some GIFS won't be super related, but it's ok.
