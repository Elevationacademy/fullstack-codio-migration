The Feature that we will be adding to the Project is **Pagination ‚≠ê**

While we progress in developing our App, we notice that sometimes we have too many recipes displayed and it was overwhelming to read all of them.

We want to add the ability to display our recipes partly, meaning we want to send the recipes in patches (pages).

so you will need to implement the following:

- a `pagination` functionality to get a fixed amount of `recipes` in a request and display them in the client.
- a `navigation` functionality to navigate between the patches of the `recipes`

This means we will be in control of how many recipes we will display in a page and keep track of which recipes are displayed.

## Pagination

it means sending the data in patches, for the first result your limit would be for example 5 results.
so if you have 19 results of recipes. 
you will need to send 4 batches each one of them has 5 results.

### Bonus (complete this feature if you have the time)
Take care of edge case!
Make sure we can not navigate more or less than the results we got.

## Notice

Please notice that you will need to edit both `Client` and `Server`.
