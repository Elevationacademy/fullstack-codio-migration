The Feature that we will add to the Project is **Exclude Ingredient**.

Sometimes we just really really dislike a certain ingredient.

**cough.. cough...** (cilantro)

so we want to have the ability to filter recipes that contain this ingredient.

![](https://www.myweekendplan.asia/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/CAT-COOKING-FOOD_-_-Now-This-Will-Make-Your-Day-.jpg)

so you will need to implement the following:

- a functionality to filter `recipes` that contain an `ingredient` but exclude another `ingredient`.

for Example, if we search for `apples`, we will recive the following [result](https://recipes-goodness-elevation.herokuapp.com/recipes/ingredient/apples)

and if we dislike **Cardamom**, then it should show us only one result that doesn't contain it.
