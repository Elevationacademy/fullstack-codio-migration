The Feature that we will add to the Project is Error Handling.

we want to deal with possible Errors and exceptions in the Backend, and display an appropriate message in the Frontend.

Please handle the following scenarios:
1. No Items found. You searched for recipes with a specific ingredient but there are no recipes available.
1. Check what happens when you send an empty string or a space. Handle that option as well
