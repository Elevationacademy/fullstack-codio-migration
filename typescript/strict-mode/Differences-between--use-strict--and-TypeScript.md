Strict-mode in TypeScript is different than ‘use strict’ in JavaScript. In general terms, if you set `”strict”: true` in TypeScript, then it will place `”use strict”;` at the top of your JavaScript code.

However, using TypeScript, you have the power to control more granular strict options. The common attributes are explained below (these configurations appear in the ‘tsconfig.json’ file):
- **noImplicitAny.** If this attribute is set to true, then function parameters without a type will throw an exception, as TypeScript will use them as ‘any’ type which basically means the compiler will ignore type-checking this attribute
- **noImplicitThis.** If this attribute is set to true, the when ‘this’ is used within a function, it must be type-defined. You can use two methods to resolve this, either by defining the first property in the function to read `x(this: {type})` or by using an arrow function
- **strictNullChecks.** If this attribute is set to true, when you set a type for a variable, TypeScript will require you to always have some value set to it, if you’d like to add an ability to hold a ‘null’ value at some point, you will need to define a variable to a specific type OR a ‘null’ value, e.g. 
`let first_name: string | null = "John"`
