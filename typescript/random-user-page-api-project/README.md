# Intro

Now that you know how to request data from **API**s and use `Handlebars.js` to render data on a page really easily - it's time to put your skills to work!

  

You'll be making a **Random-User-Page-Generator** ðŸ—¿.

 What exactly is a **Random-User-Page-Generator**ðŸ—¿ (or **RUPG** for short, pronounced _ruh-pa-geh_)?

  It's essentially a Facebook profile page, filled with content taken from **API**s and generated with different data at the click of a button.

You'll be using **API**s, **jQuery**, **Handlebars**, **Promises**, **TypeScript** and of course creating it all in **OOP**.


 Are you Excited ðŸ¤©? Great, because **RUPG** is a multi-million-dollar-application just waiting for you to create it!
