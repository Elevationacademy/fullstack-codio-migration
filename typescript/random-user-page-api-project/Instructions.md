Here is some general guidelines, let's go through each part of the project and outline your requirements:


### General Guidelines

- Remember to write **Clean code** and divide the module's correctly. 
- Make sure to use **TypeScript** when working on this project.
- you will test your project with some unit tests written with **JEST**.(later in extension)
---

### Renderer Module
Your Renderer is a _**class**_ which should render each section of the user page through Handlebars (and jQuery).

---

### HTML
 Should consist of your Handlebars scripts

Hint: you can have multiple scripts if you need.

---

### Data Model

This model is in charge of handling all data related functionalities, it should make all the **API**'s request and able to generate a user's data.


---

### Controller

Guidelines for the controller:
Use the instances of your classes with **MVC** principles so that when the user clicks the generate user button, it will fetch and load the data on the screen

### Styling

if you are unable to do your own styling can use the following [**Template Project**](https://github.com/Elevationacademy/RUPG-Master.git)
