Create a function called ‘sum()’ which takes an array of numbers, calculates the sum of all numbers and returns that value.

Create a 2nd function called ‘isEven()’ which takes a number and returns ‘true’ if it’s an even number, of ‘false’ if it’s an odd number.

Run 3 examples of calling ‘isEven()’ and ‘sum()’ with a random array of numbers. For each example use ‘console.log()’ to print the array, followed by the sum, followed by the result of the ‘isEven()’ function.
